# CS124-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms course at The University of Vermont

* **Project 1:** Collect a data set, read it into a C++ program, and describe data set in a writeup
* **Project 2:** Create a C++ class for your data set and use logic from your previous project to read the data from a file into 1000+ objects. Your class should have at least 5 fields where at least one is a numerical type and at least one is a string type. You should have constructors, getters, setters, and other methods as appropriate. You also need to create a function that will go through your data and perform some kind of calculation on it.
* **Project 3:** Perform a series of searches for 1000+ objects stored in a Binary Search Tree, an AVL Tree, and a Splay Tree. For each search, you will record how many objects you had to visit to complete the search. You will analyze your results from the different data structures.
* **Project 4:** Sort the 1000 objects from your data set. You will modify each sorting algorithm to collect data. You will analyze the results from the different sorting algorithms.
* **Project 5:** Hash the 1000 objects from your data set. You will experiment to see what size hash table and which collision detection algorithm works best for your data
